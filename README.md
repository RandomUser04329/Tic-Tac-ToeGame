# Tic-Tac-ToeGame
A mini project given by the Odin Project that mainly utilizes Javascript factory functions.

The project has a lot of commits i know, but all of it is coded solo (all of my projects are) with a slight usage of AI (asked questions on what it recommended / how certain operators or elements worked).
The game has gone through MANY tests and all the problems that i ran into were fixed, however one issue that i know that is lingering is that the game will let you go twice on a turn. I will fix it soon 
just i feel that now im more comfortable with saying that the game is finally done after weeks of developing. 
Hope you enjoy and let me know what other errors you may come across.
